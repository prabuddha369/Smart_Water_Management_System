**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient IoT-based system for managing water tanks. The system will utilize sensors to monitor water levels, temperature, and quality, providing real-time data and alerts to users.

**Key Features**

* **Real-time Water Level Monitoring:** Accurate measurement of water levels in the tank using ultrasonic sensor.
* **Remote Access and Control:** Enabling users to monitor and control the system from anywhere using blynk cloud.
* **Alerts and Notifications:** Sending timely notifications for low water levels.
* **Data Logging and Analysis:** Storing historical data for analysis and trend identification.

**Hardware Components**

* **Microcontroller:** ESP 8266
* **Sensors:**
  * Water level sensor ultrasonic HC SR04
* **Communication Module:** Wifi
* **Power Supply:** 9v Battery

**Software Components**

* **Firmware:** C++, Arduino IDE
* **Cloud Platform:** Blynk Cloud

**Getting Started**

1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the hardware components according to the provided schematics.
2. **Firmware Development:** Write the firmware code to interface with the sensors, communicate with the cloud, and handle alerts.
3. **Cloud Integration:** Set up the blynk cloud platform to store and analyze data.
4. **Testing and Deployment:** Test the system thoroughly and deploy it to the desired location.

**Future Enhancements**

* **Integration with water utility providers:** Sharing data with utilities for demand management and leak detection.
* **Predictive maintenance:** Using historical data to predict sensor failures and schedule maintenance.
* **Energy efficiency:** Optimizing water usage and storage to reduce energy consumption.
